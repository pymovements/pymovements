  BSCII dataset :cite:p:`BSCII`.

  The Beijing Sentence Corpus II (BSCII) is a Traditional Chinese sentence corpus of eye-tracking
  data, based on the original Beijing Sentence Corpus (BSC) in Simplified Chinese. Data was
  collected from 60 native Traditional Chinese readers. The corpus enables analyses of word
  frequency, visual complexity, and predictability on fixation location and duration.

  Since the BSCII sentences are nearly identical to those in the BSC, the two corpora together
  provide a valuable resource for studying cross-script similarities and differences between
  Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

  Eye-movements were recorded with an Eyelink 1000 system at 1000 Hz.
