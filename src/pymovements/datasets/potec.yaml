  PoTeC dataset :cite:p:`PoTeC`.

  The Potsdam Textbook Corpus (PoTeC) is a naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading
  corpus containing data from 75 participants reading 12 scientific texts.
  PoTeC is the first naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading corpus that contains
  eye-movements from domain-experts as well as novices in a within-participant
  manipulation: It is based on a 2×2×2 fully crossed factorial design which includes
  the participants' level of study and the participants' discipline of study as
  between-subject factors and the text domain as a within-subject factor. The
  participants' reading comprehension was assessed by a series of text comprehension
  questions, and their domain knowledge was tested by text-independent
  background questions for each of the texts. The materials are annotated for a
  variety of linguistic features at different levels. We envision PoTeC to be used
  for a wide range of studies, including but not limited to analyses of expert and
  non-expert reading strategies.

  The corpus and all the accompanying data at all
  stages of the preprocessing pipeline and all code used to preprocess the data are
  made available via `GitHub. <https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/PoTeC>`_
