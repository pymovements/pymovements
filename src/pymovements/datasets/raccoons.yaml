  RaCCooNS dataset :cite:p:`RaCCooNS`.

  The Radboud Coregistration Corpus of Narrative Sentences (RaCCooNS) dataset consists
  simultaneously recorded eye-tracking and EEG data from Dutch sentence reading,
  aimed at studying human sentence comprehension and evaluating computational
  language models. The dataset includes 37 participants reading 200 narrative sentences,
  with eye movements and brain activity recorded to analyze reading behavior
  and neural responses. The dataset provides both raw and preprocessed data,
  including fixation-related potentials, enabling comparisons between cognitive
  and neural processes.

  Check the respective paper :cite:p:`RaCCooNS` for details.

  This dataset currently cannot be fully processed by ``pymovements`` due to an error during
