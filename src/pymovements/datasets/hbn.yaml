  HBN dataset :cite:p:`HBN`.

  This dataset consists of recordings from children
  watching four different age-appropriate videos: (1) an
  educational video clip (Fun with Fractals), (2) a short animated
  film (The Present), (3) a short clip of an animated film (Despicable Me),
  and (4) a trailer for a feature-length movie (Diary of a Wimpy Kid).
  The eye gaze was recorded at a sampling rate of 120 Hz.

  Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`HBN`.
