  InteRead dataset :cite:p:`InteRead`.

  This dataset includes monocular eye tracking data in an interrupted reading task.
  Automatic interruption occurred during a reading task and participants continued
  reading after the pause.
  Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 1200Hz with a video-based eye tracker.
  Provided data are raw gaze samples and precomputed event files both in pixel coordinates.

  For more details, check the paper :cite:p:`InteRead`.
