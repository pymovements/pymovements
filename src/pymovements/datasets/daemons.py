    """DAEMONS dataset :cite:p:`DAEMONS`.

    The DAEMONS paper presents the Potsdam dataset of eye movements on natural scenes,
    aimed at advancing research in visual cognition and machine learning.
    It introduces a large-scale dataset with 2,400 images and eye-tracking data
    from 250 participants, ensuring high-quality data collection using
    state-of-the-art equipment. The study focuses on both fixation distributions
    and scan paths, making the dataset valuable for various modeling approaches,
    including saliency prediction and cognitive modeling.

    The dataset is split into train (precomputed_events[0]) and
    validation (precomputed_events[1]).

    Check the respective paper for details :cite:p:`DAEMONS`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the dataset.

    long_name: str
        The entire name of the dataset.

    resources: ResourceDefinitions
        A list of dataset gaze_resources. Each list entry must be a dictionary with the following
        keys:
        - `resource`: The url suffix of the resource. This will be concatenated with the mirror.
        - `filename`: The filename under which the file is saved as.
        - `md5`: The MD5 checksum of the respective file.

    filename_format: dict[str, str] | None
        Regular expression which will be matched before trying to load the file. Namedgroups will
        appear in the `fileinfo` dataframe.

    filename_format_schema_overrides: dict[str, dict[str, type]] | None
        If named groups are present in the `filename_format`, this makes it possible to cast
        specific named groups to a particular datatype.

    column_map: dict[str, str]
        The keys are the columns to read, the values are the names to which they should be renamed.

    custom_read_kwargs: dict[str, dict[str, Any]]
        If specified, these keyword arguments will be passed to the file reading function.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize your :py:class:`~pymovements.dataset.Dataset` object with the
    :py:class:`~pymovements.datasets.DAEMONS` definition:

    >>> import pymovements as pm
    >>>
    >>> dataset = pm.Dataset("DAEMONS", path='data/DAEMONS')

    Download the dataset resources:

    >>> dataset.download()# doctest: +SKIP

    Load the data into memory:

    >>> dataset.load()# doctest: +SKIP
