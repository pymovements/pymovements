  TECO dataset :cite:p:`TECO`.

  The Tsukuba Eye-tracking Corpus (TECO) provides eye-tracking data from 41 Japanese
  learners of English, who read 30 English passages with a total of over 410,000 tokens.

  This dataset includes detailed eye-movement measures such as skipping,
  first fixation duration, and regression, offering insights into the cognitive processes
  underlying second-language reading. TECO also examines the impact of lexical and reader factors,
  like word length and reading proficiency, on eye-tracking behavior.

  The dataset aims to support research on L2 reading comprehension.
