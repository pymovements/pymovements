  Eye-Tracking Dyslexia Dataset (ETDD70) :cite:p:`ETDD70`.

  This dataset includes binocular eye tracking data from 70 Czech children age 9-10.
  Eye movements are recorded at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz eye tracker and
  precomputed events are reported.

  Each participant is instructed to read three texts:
      - Task called Syllables contains 90 syllables arranged in a 9 x 10 matrix
      - Task called MeaningfulText consists of a passage about
        a young boy who watches a squirrel from his window.
      - Task called PseudoText comprises fictional, meaningless words.
