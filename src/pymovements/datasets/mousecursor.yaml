  MouseCursor dataset :cite:p:`MouseCursor`.

  The paper presents a dataset for comparing two types of eye tracking:
  smooth (vestibulo-ocular reflex or VOR-based) and saccadic eye tracking.
  Data were collected using a head-mounted infrared camera system that adjusted
  the mouse cursor based on pupil position.
  The experiments involved two participants completing tasks to either position the
  cursor within target areas or move it to a target location as quickly as possible.
  The dataset is intended to help researchers evaluate and compare eye tracking methods
  without needing to build the system themselves.
