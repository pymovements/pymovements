# Code of Conduct

At **pymovements**, we are commited to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

It is important to us that all participants treat one anotherâ€™s person and contributions with respect and dignity, regardless of race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical appearance, neurodiversity, disability, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, religion or philosophical belief, national or social origin, socio-economic background, education level, or any other characteristic.

All who participate in good faith and in accordance with this Code of Conduct are entitled to the same privileges of participation, whether as contributors, maintainers, users, or collaborators.

## Encouraged Behaviors

We recognize that we all come from different cultures, languages, and communication styles, and that misunderstandings can easily arise in large collaborative projects. We therefore strive for patience, mindfulness, and generosity toward each other, centering our shared values:

- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole
- Taking responsibility for one's own actions and contributions
- Committing to resolving conflicts when they arise

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community. Any instances, threats, or promotion of such behavior constitute a violation of this Code of Conduct:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Sexualized or discriminatory language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing private information without consent
- Any other conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

All reports will be reviewed and handled with confidentiality and fairness. Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.
