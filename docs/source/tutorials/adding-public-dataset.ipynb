    "- [**Basic**](#basic): You have never used pymovements before and don't have any programming experience  \n",
    "  → You will learn how to create an issue that will allow pymovement maintainers to add your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Intermediate**](#intermediate): You have some experience with programming, but are not familiar with Git  \n",
    "  → You will learn how to create a pull request with a draft of your dataset definition file\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Advanced**](#advanced): You are proficient in Python and familiar with Git  \n",

    "- Your data must be openly available and downloadable from a simple link without requiring additional steps like logging in. We recommend [OSF](https://osf.io/) for hosting your files, but other platforms like Zenodo or GitHub will also work.\n",
    "- Your data must be stored in one of the supported formats: CSV, ASC (EyeLink), IPC/Feather.\n",
    "- Your dataset may consist of multiple files, including ZIP files containing nested folders.\n",
    "- Trial information (e.g., trial or participant IDs) may be stored as additional columns in the data files, in the filenames, or as messages in ASC files."
