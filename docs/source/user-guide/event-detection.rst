============================
Detecting Occumotoric Events
============================

event types (mention all possible events, but focus on the ones we can detect)
- fixations, saccades, blinks
- event detection can show the described events
- plots: scanpathplot for fixations, main sequence saccades
- intra fixational eye movements: microsaccades, drift, tremor
- post-saccadic oscillations (glissades/ PSO)
- smooth pursuit

evaluating detected events
- precision measure for fixations
