If no `time_column` is provided and no time information can be inferred, a time axis can still be generated if an experiment definition with a sampling rate is available (see Sampling Steps below)."

    "### Defining Gaze Components\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters define how raw table columns are grouped into structured gaze signals inside the {py:class}`~pymovements.Gaze` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Description | Typical Unit |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| `pixel_columns` | Gaze positions in screen pixel coordinates | pixels (px) |\n",
    "| `position_columns` | Gaze positions already in degrees of visual angle (dva) | dva (°) |\n",
    "| `velocity_columns` | Gaze velocity components | dva/s or px/s |\n",
    "| `acceleration_columns` | Gaze acceleration components | dva/s² or px/s² |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When provided, these columns are **combined into nested columns** inside the `samples` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pixel` → pixel coordinates  \n",
    "- `position` → dva coordinates  \n",
    "- `velocity` → velocity signal  \n",
    "- `acceleration` → acceleration signal  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supported Component Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of columns determines whether the data are monocular or binocular:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Number of columns | Interpretation | Expected order |\n",
    "|-------------------|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **2 columns** | Monocular | x, y |\n",
    "| **4 columns** | Binocular | left x, left y, right x, right y |\n",
    "| **6 columns** | Binocular + cyclopean | left x, left y, right x, right y, cyclopean x, cyclopean y |\n",
    "\n",
    "If the column order differs from this convention, values may be assigned to the wrong eye or component, so it is important to provide columns in the correct sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pixel vs. Position Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically provide **either**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pixel_columns` → if your data are in screen pixels (most common for raw exports)  \n",
    "- `position_columns` → if your data are already converted to degrees of visual angle  \n",
    "\n",
    "If both are provided, `pymovements` keeps both representations, allowing you to switch between coordinate systems without recomputing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversions between the two require a valid experiment definition (screen size + viewing distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using an Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing an {py:class}`~pymovements.Experiment` connects gaze samples to\n",
    "screen geometry and sampling rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic Column Detection \n",
    "\n",
    "The exist an option for automatic column detection, though it is still under development. Currently, the naming schemes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- column name prefixes define the type of data (e.g., `pixel`, `position`)\n",
    "- column name suffixes define the component (e.g. `x`, `y`, `xr`, `yl`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means only column names like `pixel_x`, `position_xr` or `acceleration_xa` can be inferred. If the described schema fits your set-up, you can enable ``auto_column_detect=True``."
