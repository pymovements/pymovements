User Guide
==========

This user guide introduces the core concepts, data structures, and workflows
used in pymovements for processing and analyzing eye-tracking data.
It is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to move
from raw recordings to analysis-ready and reusable datasets.

The guide focuses on *conceptual understanding* and *transparent data
processing*, rather than step-by-step recipes.
Throughout this guide, we emphasize that there is no single "correct"
eye-tracking pipeline. Processing choices depend on research goals and data
quality, and each transformation introduces assumptions that should be made
explicit for reproducible analysis.
