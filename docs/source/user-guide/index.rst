This user guide introduces the concepts, data structures, and workflows
used in pymovements. It is intended for students, researchers, and
practitioners who work with eye-tracking data and want to understand how
to move from raw recordings to analysis-ready and reusable datasets.

The guide focuses on *conceptual understanding* and *transparent data
processing*, rather than step-by-step recipes. For hands-on examples,
see the Tutorials section.
