User Guide
==========

This user guide introduces the core concepts, data structures, and workflows
used in pymovements for processing and analyzing eye-tracking data.
It is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to move
from raw recordings to analysis-ready and reusable datasets.

The guide focuses on *conceptual understanding* and *transparent data
processing*, rather than step-by-step recipes.
Throughout this guide, we emphasize that there is no single "correct"
eye-tracking pipeline. Processing choices depend on research goals and data
quality, and each transformation introduces assumptions that should be made
explicit for reproducible analysis.

.. In the following sections, you will learn how to:

.. - understand the structure and meaning of eye-tracking data,
.. - inspect and evaluate data quality,
.. - preprocess raw samples,
.. - detect and evaluate oculomotoric events,
.. - work with standardized datasets and metadata,
.. - visualize eye movements and summarize behavior,
.. - prepare, validate, and publish reusable eye-tracking datasets.
