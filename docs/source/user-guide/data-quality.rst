Inspecting Data Quality
=======================

After loading and initial inspection of raw gaze data, the next step is to assess data quality.
High-quality data is essential for reliable analysis and interpretation of eye-tracking results.
Common data quality issues include missing data, noise, drift, and artifacts caused by blinks or
head movements.

Data quality plays a central role throughout this process. Calibration errors, data loss, or
unstable sampling can propagate through multiple processing steps and substantially affect both
event detection and derived measures.
