    "# Detecting Occumotoric Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Eye-tracking data are typically segmented into discrete events such as `fixations` and `saccades`. Fixations represent periods during which the eyes remain relatively stable, enabling visual information processing. Saccades are the rapid eye movements that shift gaze between fixations. Detecting these events and computing their properties, such as fixation duration and dispersion, or saccade amplitude and peak velocity, forms the foundation for analyzing visual behavior and understanding how participants explore a stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase the event detection methods, we first create a `Gaze` object and do the necessary pre-processing as described in {doc}`Working with Raw Gaze Samples <inspect-raw-samples>`."

Consecutive fixation samples are then merged into fixation events. A commonly used default threshold is 20 degrees per second, though this value may vary depending on the recording setup and research question. `pymovements` implements this methods with the {py:func}`~pymovements.events.detection.ivt` function.\n",

The algorithm slides a moving window over the data: if the dispersion within the window is sufficiently small, the window is classified as a fixation and is expanded until the dispersion criterion is violated. `pymovements` function: {py:func}`~pymovements.events.detection.idt`."

In `pymovements`, saccades (including microsaccades) can be detected from the velocity signal using the {py:func}`~pymovements.events.detection.microsaccades` function. This method implements a **noise-adaptive velocity threshold**. Instead of using a fixed velocity cutoff, the threshold is scaled relative to the noise level of the velocity signal. This makes the detection procedure more robust across recordings with different noise characteristics.\n",
