description: 'GazeGraph dataset :cite:p:`GazeGraph`.


  The dataset is collected from eight subjects (four female and four male,

  aged between 24 and 35) using the Pupil Core eye tracker. During data collection,

  the subjects wear the eye tracker and sit in front of the computer screen

  (a 34-inch display) at a distance of approximately 50cm. We conduct the

  manufacturer''s default on-screen five-point calibration for each of

  the subjects.

  Note that we have done only one calibration per subject, and the subjects

  can move their heads and upper bodies freely during the experiment.

  The gaze is recorded at a 30Hz sampling rate.
