description: "PoTeC dataset :cite:p:`PoTeC`.\n\nThe Potsdam Textbook Corpus (PoTeC)\
  \ is a naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading\ncorpus containing data from 75 participants\
  \ reading 12 scientific texts.\nPoTeC is the first naturalistic eye-tracking-while-reading\
  \ corpus that contains\neye-movements from domain-experts as well as novices in\
  \ a within-participant\nmanipulation: It is based on a 2\xD72\xD72 fully crossed\
  \ factorial design which includes\nthe participants' level of study and the participants'\
  \ discipline of study as\nbetween-subject factors and the text domain as a within-subject\
  \ factor. The\nparticipants' reading comprehension was assessed by a series of text\
  \ comprehension\nquestions, and their domain knowledge was tested by text-independent\n\
  background questions for each of the texts. The materials are annotated for a\n\
  variety of linguistic features at different levels. We envision PoTeC to be used\n\
  for a wide range of studies, including but not limited to analyses of expert and\n\
  non-expert reading strategies.\n\nThe corpus and all the accompanying data at all\n\
  stages of the preprocessing pipeline and all code used to preprocess the data are\n\
  made available via `GitHub. <https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/PoTeC>`_\n"
