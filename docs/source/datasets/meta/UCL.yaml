description: "UCL dataset :cite:p:`UCL`.\n\n  UCL is a dataset of word-by-word reading\
  \ times collected through\n  self-paced reading and eye-tracking experiments to\
  \ evaluate\n  computational psycholinguistic models of English sentence comprehension.\n\
  \  361 sentences from narrative sources, ensuring they were understandable without\
  \ context,\n  and recorded reading times from participants using both methods.\n\
  \n  For more details check out the original paper :cite:p:`UCL`.\n"
