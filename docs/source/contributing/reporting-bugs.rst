 Reporting Bugs
================

If you discover a bug, as a first step, please check the existing
[Issues](https://github.com/pymovements/pymovements/issues) to see if this bug has already been
reported.

In case the bug has not been reported yet, please do the following:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/pymovements/pymovements/issues/new?labels=bug&template=ISSUE.md).
- Add a descriptive title to the issue and write a short summary of the problem.
- We provide you with a default template to guide you through a typical reporting process.
- Adding more context, including error messages and references to the problematic parts of the code,
  would be very helpful to us.

Once a bug is reported, our development team will try to address the issue as quickly as possible.
